# Climate_Risk_CO2_Dash
Dashboard built on Plotly that examines the relationship between the amount of CO2 a country produces and its global climate risk. The data for CO2 Emissions was pulled from the My World in Data Co2 Emissions dataset and the climate risk data was pulled from the ND-Gain Index. The Co2 emissions dataset includes some territories in addition to all countries, however the territories haven't been included in the dashboard because the GeoJson file did not include coordinate data for the territories and it is challenging to find GeoJson files for small territories. As a future task, GeoJson files for territories can be created so that the territories can be integrated into the Dash application. Another feature that can be incorporated into the dashboard are graphs analyzing other related datapoints, such as a country's climate risk as it relates to the percent of the country's energy coming from renewable sources, the number of natural distasters in last 100 years, and the government stability.
